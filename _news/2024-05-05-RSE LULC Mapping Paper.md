Research SpotlightðŸ’¡: *An integrated time series mapping method enhances LULC accuracy and frequency in cloud-prone areas using spectral-indices-fused deep learning models and reconstruction techniques. The assessment shows variations in accuracy with different cloud masks, highlighting their importance in LULC mapping.*
