Our new paper entitled *Learning spectral-indices-fused deep models for time-series land use and land cover mapping in cloud-prone areas: The case of Pearl River Delta* has been published in **Remote Sensing of Environment** ([HTML](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114190), [PDF](../assets/pdf/2024.7_RSE_Learning spectral-indices-fused deep models for time-series land use and land cover mapping in cloud-prone areas.pdf)).<br>

Research SpotlightðŸ’¡: *An integrated time series mapping method enhances LULC accuracy and frequency in cloud-prone areas using spectral-indices-fused deep learning models and reconstruction techniques. The assessment shows variations in accuracy with different cloud masks, highlighting their importance in LULC mapping.* ([PAIR News](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/pair/news-and-events/news/2024/20240613_rils-develops-deep-learning-based-remote-sensing-image-classification/?sc_lang=en), [Blog](https://zhiweili.net/blog/2024/lulc-mapping/), [WeChat Article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bcfUf3LVpKBu-zWNy3Erww))
