Our new paper entitled *Beyond clouds: Seamless flood mapping using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series imagery and water occurrence data* has been published in **ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing** ([HTML](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2024.07.022), [PDF](../assets/pdf/2024.10_ISPRS P&RS_Beyond cloudsï¼šSeamless flood mapping using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series imagery and water occurrence data.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/dr-lizhiwei/SeamlessFloodMapper)).<br>

Research SpotlightðŸ’¡: *We developed [SeamlessFloodMapper](https://github.com/dr-lizhiwei/SeamlessFloodMapper) for seamless flood mapping using optical satellite image time series, overcoming cloud cover limitations. Evaluated with Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2, it maps floods seamlessly at a 2â€“3 day interval and 30 m resolution, supporting effective flood monitoring and disaster management.*
