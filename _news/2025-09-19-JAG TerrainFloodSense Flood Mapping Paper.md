Our new paper entitled *TerrainFloodSense: Improving seamless flood mapping with cloudy satellite imagery via water occurrence and terrain data fusion* has been published in the **International Journal of Applied Earth Observations and Geoinformation** ([HTML](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2025.104855), [PDF](../assets/pdf/2025.11_JAG_TerrainFloodSenseï¼šImproving seamless flood mapping with cloudy satellite imagery via water occurrence and terrain data fusion.pdf), [Code](https://github.com/dr-lizhiwei/TerrainFloodSense)).<br>

Research SpotlightðŸ’¡: *TerrainFloodSense enables seamless flood mapping using optical satellite imagery even under cloud cover. Through Bayesian fusion of water occurrence and terrain data, it reconstructs cloud-covered flooded areas, improving seamless flood monitoring and impact assessment during extreme events.*
