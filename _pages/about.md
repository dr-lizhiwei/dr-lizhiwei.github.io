**<font color=brown>:pushpin:Call for Manuscripts</font>** - Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing (PE&RS) ([Link](https://my.asprs.org/PERS))

I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil, Urban, Earth, and Environmental Engineering (<a href='https://uee.unist.ac.kr/eng/'>CUEEn</a>) at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (<a href='https://www.unist.ac.kr/'>UNIST</a>). I am affiliated with the Intelligent Remote sensing and geospatial Information Science (IRIS) Lab led by [Prof. Jungho Im](https://irisunist.wixsite.com/irislab/professor).

My research focuses on **Remote Sensing of Cloudy and Rainy Environments**, leveraging big Earth observation data and GeoAI to address environmental and climate change challenges, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions prone to frequent cloud cover and heavy rainfall. The specific research interests include urban and environmental remote sensing, cloud detection and removal, land cover/use mapping, and flood monitoring and risk assessment. I have authored over 20 journal papers in *RSE*, *ISPRS P&RS*, *JAG*, *IEEE TGRS*, etc., with a total of over 3,400 citations (as of September 2025 in <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SlXpfWMAAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar</a>), five of which have been selected as üèÜESI Highly Cited Papers.

I earned my Ph.D. in Cartography and Geoinformation Engineering from Wuhan University in 2020, and B.Eng. in Geo-Information Science and Technology from China University of Geosciences in 2015. Prior to my current position, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Wuhan University (2020‚Äì2022), and as a Research Assistant Professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2022‚Äì2025). I have been the PI of multiple projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The methods and tools I developed have been used to generate national and regional remote sensing data products and to support national land resource monitoring by the China Land Survey and Planning Institute (CLSPI) and other related departments.
