**<font color=red>I am recruiting part-time Research Assistants for 2024!</font>**

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lsgi/'>Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI)</a> at <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/'>The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)</a>. I am also affiliated with the PolyU JC STEM Lab of Earth Observations (POLEIS) and the Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Geomatics (RCAIG), led by [Prof. Qihao Weng](https://qihaoweng.net/).

My research interests primarily focus on **Remote Sensing of Cloudy and Rainy Environments**, which involves applying big Earth data and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) for environment and climate change-related research and applications, especially in cloudy and rainy tropical/subtropical regions. The specific research topics include urban remote sensing, cloud detection and removal, multi-source data fusion, land cover/use mapping, flood monitoring, etc. I have authored more than 20 journal and conference papers in *RSE*, *ISPRS P&RS*, *IEEE JSTARS*, etc., with a total of over 1800 citations (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SlXpfWMAAAAJ'>Google Scholar</a>), four of which have been selected as ESI Highly Cited Papers.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Cartography and Geoinformation Engineering from Wuhan University in 2020. Prior to my current position, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Wuhan University from 2020 to 2022. I have been the PI of one project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and two projects funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation. The methods and tools I developed have been widely applied in the preprocessing of multiple types of satellite images, supporting national land resource monitoring by the China Land Survey and Planning Institute and other related departments.
