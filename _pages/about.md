**<font color=brown>:pushpin:Call for Manuscripts</font>** - Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing (PE&RS) ([Link](https://my.asprs.org/PERS))

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (<a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lsgi/'>LSGI</a>) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (<a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/'>PolyU</a>). I am also affiliated with the PolyU JC STEM Lab of Earth Observations (POLEIS) and the Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Geomatics (RCAIG), both led by [Prof. Qihao Weng](https://qihaoweng.net/).

My research focuses on **Remote Sensing of Cloudy and Rainy Environments**, leveraging big Earth observation data and GeoAI to address environmental and climate change challenges, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions prone to frequent cloud cover and heavy rainfall. The specific research topics include urban and environmental remote sensing, cloud detection and removal, land cover/use mapping, and flood monitoring and risk assessment. I have authored over 20 journal papers in *RSE*, *ISPRS P&RS*, *JAG*, *IEEE TGRS*, etc., with a total of over 3,000 citations (as of April 2025 in <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SlXpfWMAAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar</a>), four of which have been selected as üèÜESI Highly Cited Papers.

I earned my Ph.D. in Cartography and Geoinformation Engineering from Wuhan University in June 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Huanfeng Shen. Prior to my current position, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Wuhan University from July 2020 to June 2022. I have been the PI of multiple projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The methods and tools I developed have been widely used to generate national and regional remote sensing data products and to support national land resource monitoring by the China Land Survey and Planning Institute (CLSPI) and other related departments.
