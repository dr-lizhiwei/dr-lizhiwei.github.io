I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (<a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lsgi/'>LSGI</a>) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (<a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/'>PolyU</a>). I am also affiliated with the PolyU JC STEM Lab of Earth Observations (POLEIS) and the Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Geomatics (RCAIG), both led by [Prof. Qihao Weng](https://qihaoweng.net/).

My research primarily focuses on **Remote Sensing of Cloudy and Rainy Environments**, leveraging big Earth observation data and GeoAI to tackle environmental and climate change challenges, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions with frequent cloud cover and heavy rainfall. The specific research topics include urban/environmental remote sensing, cloud detection and removal, land cover/use mapping, and flood monitoring. I have authored over 20 journal papers in *RSE*, *ISPRS P&RS*, *IEEE TGRS*, etc., with a total of over 2600 citations (as of November 2024 in <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SlXpfWMAAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar</a>), among which four have been selected as üèÜESI Highly Cited Papers.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Cartography and Geoinformation Engineering from Wuhan University in June 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Huanfeng Shen and Prof. Zongyi He. Prior to my current position, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Wuhan University from July 2020 to June 2022. I have been the PI of one project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and two projects funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation. The methods and tools I developed have been widely applied to generate national or regional remote sensing data products and to support national land resource monitoring by the China Land Survey and Planning Institute and other related departments.
