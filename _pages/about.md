**<font color=brown>I am seeking part-time Research Assistants for 2024!:pushpin:</font>**

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (<a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lsgi/'>LSGI</a>) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (<a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/'>PolyU</a>). I am also affiliated with the PolyU JC STEM Lab of Earth Observations (POLEIS) and the Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Geomatics (RCAIG), both led by [Prof. Qihao Weng](https://qihaoweng.net/).

My research primarily focuses on **Remote Sensing of Cloudy and Rainy Environments**, which involves applying big Earth data and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) for environment and climate change-related research and applications, especially in cloudy and rainy tropical/subtropical regions. The specific research topics include urban remote sensing, cloud detection and removal, multi-source data fusion, land cover/use mapping, flood monitoring. I have authored more than 20 journal and conference papers in *RSE*, *ISPRS P&RS*, *IEEE JSTARS*, etc., with a total of over 1900 citations (as of Jan 2024 in <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SlXpfWMAAAAJ'>Google Scholar</a>), among which four have been selected as ESI Highly Cited Papers.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Cartography and Geoinformation Engineering from Wuhan University in June 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Huanfeng Shen. Prior to my current position, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Wuhan University from July 2020 to June 2022. I have been the PI of one project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and two projects funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation. The methods and tools I developed have been widely applied in preprocessing multiple types of satellite images, supporting national land resource monitoring by the China Land Survey and Planning Institute and other related departments.
